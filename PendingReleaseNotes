* The MDS has lost support for the 'anchor table' mechanism that used
  to be necessary for resolving files with multiple hard links.  The
  new code instead relies on 'backtrace' attributes on objects for
  newly created files.  If you have an existing file system that
  contains files with hard links, you should ensure they have been
  updated to include backtraces before upgrading by triggering a
  modification to the file inode.  This can be accomplished with::

    find . -type f \! -links 1 -exec touch \{\} \;
